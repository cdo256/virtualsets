Hi Thorsten,

I am definitely overdue for an update. I have done a lot of work, but
my progress doens't reflect that on the surface. It ammounts to 4.5k
lines of Agda.

Since my last email I’ve switched to a simpler, inductive definition
of injective functions:

```
data Inj : ℕ → ℕ → Type where
  nul : ∀ n → Inj 0 n
  inc : ∀ {m n} → (b : Fin (suc n))
      → (f : Inj m n)
      → Inj (suc m) (suc n)
```

This replaces the previous "function plus proof of injectivity"
approach. The new structure is easier to work with, makes injectivity
guaranteed by construction, and avoids the long chains of isomorphisms
that were distracting from the main goal of proving the trace
structure for Virtual Sets. It also seems to reduce type-checking
overhead. This change has resulted in a lot of basic lemmas needing to
be defined, but that is done now.

On the results side:

I’ve proved that VSet is a category.

I’ve proved the vanishing property.

I’ve added various utility lemmas to tame transports and dependent
paths, including a transport-reorder lemma that commutes transports
with dependent functions.

I’ve got most of the strength property done, and I think I have
everything I need to complete the remaining trace axioms.

I’m no longer following Mark’s lemmas, as they didn’t match the
definitions from the nLab page or the Joyal-Street-Verity 1996 paper,
and some didn’t make sense to me. I’m now following my own notes based
on those sources. I don’t think I’m stuck at the moment, but given the
time I lost at the start (including two rewrites) I’m not sure I’ll
get as far as the compact closed construction.

It would be very helpful to have someone review my code, ideally with
me walking through it, to point out anything that could be done more
cleanly or efficiently. If you don’t have time, could you suggest
someone else who might be able to do that?

Kind regards,
Christina
