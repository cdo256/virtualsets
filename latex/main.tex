  This dissertation explores the categorical and computational structure of
  virtual sets by formalizing them as bivariate species in Agda. The central
  question is whether the category of finite sets and injections, equipped
  with a suitable tensor and trace operator, forms a traced monoidal category.
  Traced monoidal categories provide an abstract setting for feedback and
  recursion, and connect species theory to broader themes in categorical
  semantics. We develop the required background in type theory, homotopy type
  theory, and category theory, before implementing the construction in Agda.
  Our formalization establishes the monoidal structure of Inj and verifies key
  trace axioms, while also exposing challenges in mechanizing categorical
  coherence. The results demonstrate both a concrete contribution to species
  theory and a methodological contribution to the practice of mechanized
  mathematics.
