\begin{abstract}
This dissertation documents the exploration of methods to represent
the monoidal category of finite sets and injective functions, and whether a
certain operation presents a 'trace' over this category. A trace is a
categorical generalization of feedback structures such as recursion,
or feedback in quantum systems. The category of virtual sets is
roughly equivalent to sets that have negative as well as positive
membership. Such a structure is of interest in simplicial type theory,
where all inclusion map between simplicial complexes must necessarily
be injective.
